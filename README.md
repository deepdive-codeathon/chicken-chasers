# SpeechChain
#### Description
We are building a decentralized, immutable, blockchain where 
one can make a statement or a promise and place it on our immutable
ledger. In the future, we can always look back at an individuals words
and see if they stay true to what they say. For our project, we are
going to be using Twitter API to pull content off of Twitter and place it on
our blockchain. The hopes is that one day, people who are making promises
will be incentives to make that promise on our decentralized immutable ledger.  
 

#### Intended Users

* Politicians who would like to show people that they aren't intending to break
a promise.

* Friends who struggle to stay true to their word.

* Used in court rooms to determine an individual of a crime depending on
whether or not they stayed true to their word.

* As a written agreement between any two parties looking to do business.
